        * Added optional milliseconds display for clock mode (#2)
        - New --milliseconds/-m option shows time in HH:MM:SS.mmm format
        - Clock mode without -m: shows HH:MM:SS (e.g., 10:21:00)
        - Clock mode with -m: shows HH:MM:SS.mmm (e.g., 10:21:09.405)
        - Preserves existing millisecond display for timer/countdown/stopwatch modes
        - Updated documentation (README.md, utimer.1 manual page)
        - Merged latest master fixes including build system improvements
